- Many more modules out there, which NOT part of the Python installations
- built-in Modules and Packages are the most common ones
- you need to install these third party packages, 
  depending on what application(eg: web application, machine learning) you write
- you can download third party python packages from python repository(storage) called 
  PyPI--> The Python Package Index
	-it's a repository for 3rd party Python Packages
	-people can publish their packages to repository and make it available for everyone to use
	-it's a large community
